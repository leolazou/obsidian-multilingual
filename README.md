## Requirements

To use the plugin you need a Google Translate API key. You read how to get it at [Google Cloud Translation docs](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs).
The API is free up to a certain usage, usually higher than what you might require for using this plugin, even with a heavy use of Obsidian. More information on [Google Cloud Translation pricing](https://cloud.google.com/translate/pricing#basic-pricing).
